# RSpec Demo

This demo corresponds to the RSpec Lecture under W1D2->HOMEWORK. Download it
before you watch the lecture so that you can follow along and experiment on your
own machine.

See the "Practice Instructions" reading under W1D1->PROJECTS in the sidebar if
you need help downloading the demo.

You may find the following RSpec commands useful:

To run all the specs: `bundle exec rspec`  
To run specs from a specific file, e.g., __add_spec.rb__: `bundle exec rspec spec/add_spec.rb`  
To run the spec that begins, e.g., on line 4: `bundle exec rspec spec/add_spec.rb:4`
